5. watch some videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRNsqHZEzUM and read some python documentation

Note: If you are having trouble with python and just want to start coding for robots, try out this: https://codev5.vex.com/ 
This isn't exactly 'coding' but it is a good place to start, you can also look at a bot in VR so that is kind of cool
Also I can take any code you write in block and put it into python or C++ or C.
